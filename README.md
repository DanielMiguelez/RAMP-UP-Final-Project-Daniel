# Daniel's -final -project.

In here you can see the project that I have been working during the last 2 weeks, in here I mixed some of the knowledge that I have acquired during my stay in The Bridge. 

## Technologies that I have used

I have used HTML and CSS, some Flexbox,in every page, trying to make it responsive.

### Daniel's project matters of interest.
To design this webpage I also used a library called fontAwseome, within the folders you can find the info to display the emojis all along the webpage, everything that I have done is in order to keep the folders clean, and well displayed.
